# Simple_Face_Recognition
Face recognition is a popular application of computer vision that allows you to identify and verify individuals from images or video streams. In this tutorial, we will use the face recognition library in Python to build a simple face recognition system.
Before we start, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
face recognition library: You can install it using pip by running "pip install face_recognition".
Install cv2 with this command "pip install opencv-python"

if face_recognition in not going to install try to install with "WHL" file provided.

This way is good but sme times it shows "dlib" error, then make sure to install cmake with "pip install cmake" and install dlib with wheel file as "pip install <file_name>"
